<p><span class="style1">UPDATE:</span> We have removed the core files from the wordpress.org repository due to a conflict with the way wordpress stores our plugin. Because the plugin folder name is changed by wordpress.org, it caused the plugin not to work. Until further notice you may download the WordPress Auction Plugin from our website at <a href="http://www.wpauctionsoftware.com/download/">www.WPAuctionSoftware.com</a>.</p>
